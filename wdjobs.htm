                        <h3> Become a Web Developer</h3>
                      <p>
                            Ive been looking for information technology jobs personally all summer and have 
                            applied to hundreds of them. My methods include looking at my day to day activities 
                            and relate the brand to opportunities. So for example I use google a lot. Google 
                            has its own careers page that is super self explanatory and will save your application 
                            to use over and over again. I highly recommend it since it save your info and gives 
                            you an opportunity to update it before submitting. I usually use phrases like web 
                            develop, web developer, front-end, back end, help desk, information technology to 
                            pull up jobs that require the same amount of knowledge. Some jobs I found through google are:
                            
                            <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs#!t=jo&jid=/google/google-developer-advocate-seoul-south-korea-1750740001&">Developer Advocate, Web </a>
                            <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs#!t=jo&jid=/google/front-end-software-engineer-747-6th-st-s-kirkland-wa-usa-2550880173&"> Front End Software Engineer 
                            <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs#!t=jo&jid=/google/software-engineer-front-end-345-spear-st-san-francisco-ca-usa-2548010420&">Software Engineer, Front End 
                            The next thing I do is look at the apps I use on my phone so we can look at a few examples there.
                            
                            The first one I would like to start on is <a href="https://careers.pinterest.com/careers">Pinterest Careers</a> 
                            (Just a heads up I have interviewed with them and they are very particular on who they
                             hire but its literally an amazing place to work at. I highly suggest looking up their 
                             offices and just seeing how they work as a team. But then again the interview process 
                             is very difficult.) On Pinterest they section off their jobs by how common they are, 
                             all the computer jobs are listed under engineering. The only job they have available 
                             for web is <a href="https://careers.pinterest.com/careers/details/web-engineer-growth_san-francisco_613854">Web Engineer</a>, Growth.
                            The next app I personally don't use but I have family who does work there and suggested 
                            I apply also is  Facebook! I know a lot of you might have this app and use it daily so I
                             go into my web browser and type in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/">Facebook Careers </a>
                             and that link should take you to their website. They have a search bar on there and I 
                             like to be as basic as possible and type in "Web" and all the jobs related to it will 
                             pop up. The first one that did was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/a0I1200000LTJKpEAP/?q=web&location=menlo-park">Web Software Developer, Web Client (WhatsApp)</a>, heres a student
                              friendly one <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/a0I1200000LTGJBEA5/?q=web&location=menlo-park">Front End Engineer, Intern/Co-op</a> 
                            
                            SO the take away when it comes to hunting for jobs is the apps and things you use every day.
                             The best way to know a company exists is literally right in front of you. And you do not have
                              to work for a tech company! It can be from cliff bar to crayola or a school. The possibilities
                               are endless and out there. 
                            
                            If you guys want to get started on searching here are some companies Ive looked up this past summer 
                            and applied to [some]:
                            
                            <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs">Netflix</a>   (they have a <a href="https://github.com/netflix">github </a>
                            
                            <a href="https://careers.pinterest.com/">Pinterest </a>
                            
                            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/">Facebook </a>

                            <a href="https://www.edjoin.org/">edjoin.org</a> (type web, information tech, or technology and under all job categories select classified)
                            
                            <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/Search?soc=Developers%2C%20Web"> usajobs.gov </a>
                            
                            <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm">glassdoor.com </a> (This is a major website that shows company stats and the jobs they posted. I highly recommend it since there are actual interviews, salaries, benefits, and overall company reviews on there.)
