                                    <h2>Formatting page content</h2>
                                    In this series of exercises, we'll explore how to use HTML elements to 
                                    format basic page content.
                                    <h3>Adding headings</h3>
                                    Headings help define the structure of the page and control the hierarchy 
                                    of the content. You can use heading values ranging from a top-level heading
                                     of h1 all the way down to an h6. While there are several competing theories 
                                     on the exact strategy to use when choosing headings, what really matters is 
                                     that you are using them in an intelligent  manner, to accurately reflect the
                                      importance of your content. It's also important to be consistent in how you 
                                      use headings across your site, so deciding on when and how to use headings 
                                      is an important part of planning your site.
                                    <h3> Using paragraphs </h3>
                                    The paragraph tag (&lang;p&rang;) is one of the most basic formatting tags, 
                                    and one that you'll use often. It indicates a paragraph of text, and should
                                     be used for each individual paragraph.
                                    <h3>Line breaks</h3>
                                    Occasionally you'll need to perform a "soft return," that is, create a new 
                                    line without using a new paragraph. To do that in HTML, you use the line break
                                     tag (&lang;br&rang;). Line break tags are inline, meaning you can use them
                                      within headers and paragraphs, and don't require a closing tag. 
                                    Let's say you were formatting an address, for example. You could use line 
                                    breaks to make sure each line of the address appeared on a separate line,
                                     but still remained within the same paragraph.

                                    <h2>Formatting page content</h2>
                                    <p>In this series of exercises, we'll explore how to use HTML elements to format 
                                        basic page content.</p>
                                    <h3>Emphasizing text</h3>
                                    <p>Often you will want to emphasize a particular phrase or word within your text. 
                                        HTML gives you several different tags to do this with. In this exercise we'll
                                         explore the four most common formatting tags you'll use to emphasize content.</p>
                                    <dl>
                                    <dt><b>The Bold Tag</b></dt>
                                    <dd>The bold tag (&lang;b&rang;) is mean to represent a span of text that you wish
                                         to set apart stylistically from the rest of the text without inferring any type 
                                         of special relevance or meaning. It was removed in XHTML as being solely 
                                         presentational, but added back to HTML5. As you would expect, browsers
                                          typically bold this text.</dd>
                                    <dt><b>The Strong Tag</b></dt>
                                    <dd>By using the strong tag (&lang;strong&rang;) you are representing a string of 
                                        text as having strong importance. The text should be considered to be more 
                                        important than the text surrounding it. It is typically displayed as bold.</dd>
                                    <dt><b>The Italic Tag</b></dt>
                                    <dd>Like the bold tag, the italic tag (&lang;i&rang;) represents a string of text 
                                        that is set apart stylistically from the text around it. No particular meaning
                                         is attached to the text, rather it is rendered in italics. Helpful for phrases, 
                                         terms, or any text that is normally displayed in <i>italics</i>.</dd>
                                    <dt><b>The Emphasis Tag</b></dt>
                                    <dd>The emphasis tag (&lang;em&rang;), or "em" tag, denotes text that is emphasized more 
                                        than the text around it. Although this tag is usually rendered in <i>italics</i>, it 
                                        shouldn't be used in place of the italics tag, rather it should be used for text that 
                                        needs to emphasized for some reason.</dd>
                                        </dl>
                                    <h3>Wait.... what?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        You're probably wondering why there are multiple tags for bolding and italicizing text. 
                                        If you are, don't worry, <strong>you're not alone!</strong> This is one of the most 
                                        confusing aspects of learning HTML. The easiest way for me to explain it is this: 
                                        One set of tags is <em>presentational</em>, while the other is <em>logical</em>. 
                                        What that means is that presentational text doesn't convey explicit meaning, it merely 
                                        serves to change the styling of the text. Logical elements however do convey a specific 
                                        meaning. Text that is either bold or italic are just that, bold or italic. Text that is
                                        represented with a strong or em tag can represent multiple states. Using styles, for 
                                        example, you could change it so that the text is underlined or highlighted. By contrast,
                                        it wouldn't make much sense to change the styling of a bold or italic element, since 
                                        hey are represented exactly as intended.</p>
                                <p>
                                    There are other elements you'll need to research when learning about emphasizing text as well.
                                    The <b>cite tag</b> (&lang;cite&rang;), for example, is used for citing a work such as a book
                                    title, or an author, and is usually displayed as italicized text.</p>

                                    <h3>Displaying special characters</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Certain characters are reserved for HTML, meaning that you aren't allowed to use them in 
                                        regular content. Using a left angle bracket like this "&lang;" in your code can cause 
                                        rendering issues in certain situations. Other characters are special characters or 
                                        symbols that might not be available through the keyboard, or are used by other languages.
                                        To represent those characters in normal text, you can use what are known as named character 
                                        entities.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        These are special codes that the browser or user agent will then replace with the requested 
                                        character. The syntax for them is relatively straightforward. You start with an ampersand 
                                        (&amp;) followed by the named entity that is then followed by a semicolon. To display an 
                                        ampersand, for example, you would type in &amp;amp;. This can be extremely helpful when
                                        displaying &copy; and &trade; symbols, or writing mathematical formulas.</p>

                                    <h3>Controlling white space</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    By default, browsers will ignore any white space after the first space.
                                    To add additional white space, you must use the &amp;nbsp; entity.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Try it here. Add as much white space as you want here.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Keep in mind that the primary purpose of the non-breaking space is to 
                                        inform browsers when a line break shouldn't occur during a string of 
                                        text. For example, adding a non-breaking space between Formula&nbsp;One 
                                        would ensure that a line break never occurs that would split up the words 
                                        Formula and One. To that end, never use the non-breaking space character 
                                        to control paragraph indentations or fake a tab character. CSS should 
                                        control that type of visual formatting.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        <img src="images/lowcountry.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Lowcountry South Carolina">Images 
                                        are placed on the page through the use of the <b>img</b> tag. Images are considered <b>replaced content</b>,
                                        that is the element is replaced with the asset it references. The image element has several important attributes.
                                        The <b>src</b> attribute is used to tell the browser where to find the image. The <b>alt</b> attribute 
                                        allows you to pass along descriptive text representing the image. This can be used by screen readers,
                                        or displayed in the event the image fails to load.The <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> are optional 
                                        and can be used to pass the dimensions of the image to the browser. If omitted, the browser will still
                                        display the image at its native width and height. These values can be changed to force the browser to
                                        size the image differently from it's native size.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Most browser support a wide range of image types. For the most part, you're safe using jpg, png, gif, bmp, and 
                                        svg image formats.</p>
